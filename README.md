# Information
This repository can be used to conduct experiments within steganograpy. One simple method is to hide text by modifying the bytes of an image. Therefore, the bytes of a unicode text can be embedded as the last significant bits of the raw image data of an image.

This repository can be installed by running ´python -m pip install .´ in the project root folder. The main file contains examples on how to use the library. After installation, it can be run from console.
